As a user:

* As a user, I'd like to click on an employee in the list to visit their profile page.
* As a user, I'd like the option to visit an "About" page
* As a user, I'd like all data persisted in Firebase
* As a user, I'd like to filter the list of users by their particular role (teacher, front desk staff, etc)
* As an administrator, I want the ability to add new users.
* As an administrator, I want the ability to edit user profiles.
